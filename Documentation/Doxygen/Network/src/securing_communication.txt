\page secure_communication Secure Communication

In today's world, \b secure \b communication is crucial for many applications to protect data transmission between two
network nodes. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a> protocol
is a standardized technology for establishing a secure, encrypted and authenticated link between two parties over an insecure
network. TLS is an industry standard and is used in millions of devices and websites.

The Network component offers two ways to secure communication in an application:
-# \subpage use_mbed_tls
-# \subpage use_secure_components

\page use_mbed_tls Using Mbed TLS

Although the Network component does not offer encryption and secure communication on its own, you can use Arm's
<a href="https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls/" target="_blank">mbed TLS</a> software component to achieve this.

\image html secure_com_sw_stack.png

From the bottom up:
- The \b Cortex-M-based \b microcontroller provides the processor core, storage, memory and network interface.
- The \b CMSIS-RTOS compliant operating system provides standard services such as scheduling and thread-safety.
- The \b Network \b Component provides services, sockets (TCP/IP) and the interface for network communication.
- Building on top of the Network Component, \b mbed \b TLS provides an abstraction layer for secure communication.
- The \b application \b code uses Mbed TLS to abstract the secure communication from itself.

Why Mbed TLS?
-------------

The Mbed TLS library is designed for ease-of-use. The library is documented and has examples so you can easily understand how
to use it. In the Network Component, Mbed TLS is used under the
<a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank">Apache 2.0 license</a>, enabling you to use it in both
open source and closed source projects. Mbed TLS is a fully featured and standards compliant SSL library offering server and
client functionality in one single package.

Difference between SSL/TLS
--------------------------

The TLS protocol is the successor of the SSL protocol. Just like its predecessor, the TLS protocol provides communication
security for connections over possibly untrusted networks, like the Internet. The main difference between TLS and SSL is the
increased standardization of the workings of the protocol. SSL itself was designed and developed by Netscape. The newer TLS
standard is defined in a number of \ref mbed_rfcs "public RFCs" and is extended periodically to counter possible weaknesses
or add much needed functionality.

Parts of an SSL/TLS Library
---------------------------

In order to perform the SSL or TLS protocol, a number of supporting functionality is required. The SSL/TLS library:
- needs to perform symmetric cryptographic operations, such as
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">AES</a>, to encrypt the data over the
  connection.
- uses asymmetric cryptographic operations, such as 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29" target="_blank">RSA</a>, for identifying and authenticating
  the parties of the connection.
- uses message digest operations, such as the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank">SHA-256</a> hash algorithm, to protect the integrity of
  the information sent over the wire. 
- needs to be able to parse, understand and use
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509" target="_blank">X.509</a> certificates.
- has to perform network operations to send and receive the protocol packets.

All of this is hidden from most users and wrapped inside an SSL library, such as Mbed TLS, which developers can use to
implement SSL or TLS in their applications.

For more information on Mbed TLS and how it works, visit the
<a href="https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls/" target="_blank">high-level design</a> overview page.



\section add_mbedtls Add the mbed TLS library to a ÂµVision project

The \ref nw_examples section carries two examples for secure communication over the IP network: SSL Server and SSL Client.
To use the Mbed TLS library in your own projects, follow these steps:
-# Download the \b ARM:mbedTLS library from \urlout{SW-Pack} or use \urlout{uv4_ca_packinstaller}
-# Open or create a project using the \b Network \b Component.
-# Configure the Network Component as required by your application (Ethernet settings, TCP/IP communication, etc.).
-# In the <b>Manage Run-Time Environment</b> window expand \b Security and enable \b Mbed \b TLS:
\image html add_mbedTLS.png
-# Configure Mbed TLS using the \c mbedTLS_config.h file under \b Security in the \b Project window.
\image html mbedTLS_config_h.png
-# Use the \b Mbed \b TLS API to secure your communication.

\note You can use the Mbed TLS API in parallel to any of the \ref use_secure_components "secure services" that are
part of the Network Component.

/**
\page use_secure_components Using Secure Services

The Network Component offers secure software components that are using \ref use_mbed_tls "Mbed TLS". The user of the
Network Component does not see the Mbed TLS API as it is hidden by the standard API of the secure component.

Currently, the following component is available in a secure variant:
- \ref https_server
- \ref smtps_client

To be able to communicate securely, you will need to generate appropriate certificates for the server. The section \ref cert_creation
explains how to achieve this for the secure components by using additional tools that are part of the Network Component.

\section https_server HTTPS Server

The web server and the compact web server have secure variants available. In the <b>Manage Run-Time Environment</b> window
simply select the appropriate variant:

\image html select_https.png

 

\subsection add_ssl_to_http Converting the HTTP server to HTTPS

It is also possible to convert an already existing (compact) web server to a secure HTTPS web server. A few simple steps are
required to achieve this:
-# Download and install the \b ARM:mbedTLS Software Pack (see \ref add_mbedtls).
-# Change the following software components in the Manage Run-Time Environment:
   - Set <b>Network:Service:Web Server (Compact)</b> variant to \b HTTPS. This adds the file \c Net_Security.c to the
     project which contains test keys/certificates. To change them, follow the steps provided in \ref cert_creation.
   - Enable <b>Security:mbed TLS</b> or resolve this dependency automatically.
-# Update the \c mbedTLS_Config.h configuration file with the following (a copy named \c mbedTLS_config_HTTPS.h is available
   in the \b Template folder):

\note
- The first connection might take a while (a few seconds up to 10s) and depends on the browser and how many sockets/sessions
  it initially opens (differs in Edge, Chrome, Firefox, etc.). This delay is normal and due to the time required for
  asymmetric cryptography calculations on the target. After the initial delay, the HTTPS server works almost as fast the HTTP
  server.
- Your browser will complain during the connection that the certificate has a problem or is not trusted. You will need to add
  the certificate to your browser's trusted certificate storage manually.
- Do not use the test certificate in productive environments as it is not secret. Before shipping your product, make sure
  that you have added your \ref cert_creation "own certificates and keys".

  
  
\subsection cert_creation Creating your own certificates and keys

The Network Component's HTTPS service adds the file \c Net_Security.c to the project. This file contains generic test
keys/certificates which enable the application to run out of the box. If you want to adapt the keys/certificates to your
needs, you can do this by modifying this file or by executing the batch file \c Net_Security.bat that is part of the Network
Component.

\c Net_Security.bat can be registered in ÂµVision under \b Tools for general usage:
- Go to \b Tools --> <b>Customize Tools Menu</b>
- Click the <b>New (Insert)</b> button and enter a meaningful name, for example "Net_Security Keys"
- In the \b Command box enter \c $PRTE\\Network\\Net_Security.bat
- In the \b Initial \b Folder box enter \c $PRTE\\Network
- In the \b Arguments box enter \c \@K
- Enable \b Run \b Independent

\image html Net_Security_Keys.PNG "Settings required for the Net_Security.bat file"

This setting is needed only once in ÂµVision and will work for any project since it uses project related folders.

The file \c Net_Security.bat is copied to the project (.\\RTE\\Network) folder together with \c Net_Security.c. As it is
project specific, the batch file can be customized to reflect your specific values for the certificates:
- CA and Server Private Keys: type (default: RSA) and key_size (default: 2048)
- CA certificate: issuer_name (default:CN="Test CA",O="Unknown",C=US), serial (default: 0), not_before (default:
  20200101000000), not_after (20301231235959)
- Server certificate: subject_name (default: CN="localhost",O="MyOrganization",C=US), serial (default: 1), not_before
  (default: 20200101000000), not_after (20301231235959)

\note
- Replace CN="localhost" with your hostname so that you can add the server's root CA certificate to your "Trusted
  Root Certification Authorities". Then the browser will not complain that the website is not trusted.

The beginning of the file contains some  environment settings that can also be changed:
- RTEPATH: specifies the path to Software Packs. This is required if the batch file is executed directly from Windows. When
  it is executed from ÂµVision, it is set automatically.
- Pack Versions (MDK-MW and mbedTLS): only required if you want to select a specific Pack version. By default, the latest
  available Pack is used.

As soon as you run the batch file from the \b Tools menu, it will create the keys/certificates and change the
\c Net_Security.c automatically to reflect the changes. You can then continue building the project.

\note
- The Net_Security.bat file calls the pem2mw.exe utility. This utility does not support all kinds of certificates.
- If you are using an unsupported certificate, you can bypass pem2mw easily by manually creating the output Net_Security.c
  file:
  - Adapt Net_Security.bat to skip calling pem2mw (optional)
  - Copy the contents of ca.crt into NetSecurity_ServerCA structure in Net_Security.c and add leading \" and trailing \\n\"
    to each line
  - Copy the contents of server.crt into NetSecurity_ServerCert structure in Net_Security.c and add leading \" and trailing
    \\n\" to each line
  - Copy the contents of server.key into NetSecurity_ServerKey structure in Net_Security.c and add leading \" and trailing
    \\n\" to each line

\subsection cert_adding Adding server root CA certificate

The SMTPS service of the Network Component adds the \c Net_Security.c file to the project. This file contains an empty section
for the e-mail server root CA certificate, so you cannot initially build the application. You must provide a valid root CA certificate
for the server that you use to send e-mail. The certificate must be provided in PEM-encoding. Copy the contents of the certificate
into the NetSecurity_EmailServerCA structure in \c Net_Security.c and add a leading " and a trailing \n" to each line. 

\code
// Email Server root CA certificate
const uint8_t NetSecurity_EmailServerCA[] =
"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"
"... base64 data ...\n"
"-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";
\endcode

Verifying the e-mail server is required by default to increase e-mail security. If you do not want to verify the server, you
can disable server verification by defining the <b>SMTPS_SERVER_VERIFY_NONE</b> in your project (Options for Component Class Network -
SMTP_Client - C/C++ Preprocessor Symbols - Define).

\note
- It is not necessary to create your own certificates or keys to send secure e-mail using SMTPS.
