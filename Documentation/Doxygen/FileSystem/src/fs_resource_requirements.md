# Resource Requirements {#fs_resource_requirements}

This section describes the resource requirements of the **File System** component. 
The actual requirements depend on the features used in the application. Therefore, the numbers provided here are guidelines
only and the actual numbers may differ. 

## Stack Requirements {#fs_stack_req}

The File System component receives events sent from the interrupt service routine (ISR) of the drivers of the different
drives. The stack requirements for the ISR are typically less than 512 Bytes. The stack requirements for ISR are configured
in the `startup_device.s` file located under the **Device** component class.

| Option (under section Stack Configuration)                        | Increase Value by
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------
| Stack Size (in Bytes)                                             | + 512 for Driver of a Drive

\note
- When using a CMSIS-RTOS, the Stack Size in the startup_*device*.s file configures only the stack space that is used by
  exception and interrupt service routines of the drivers. The stack size requirements depend on the maximum nesting of
  exception and ISR execution and therefore on the priority settings of the various interrupt and exception sources.
- If you have multiple drives configured in your system with the same interrupt priority, you only need to add the stack
  of the drive with the largest requirement. If you have drives with nested interrupts (different priorities), you need to
  add the sum of all stack requirements.
  
## Heap Requirements{#fs_heap_req}

Heap is used by memory allocation functions. It is also configured in the `startup_device.s` file located under the **Device** component class.
For every simultaneously opened file, you need to configure 512 + 96 Bytes of additional heap. If you wish to have three files open simultaneously,
you need to configure an additional heap size of 3 x (512 + 96) Bytes.

| Option (under section Heap Configuration)                         | Increase Value by
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------
| Heap Size (in Bytes)                                              | + (512 + 96) for each open file

## CMSIS-RTOS Requirements {#fs_rtos_req}

#### Thread Stack Requirements

Although the File System component requires a CMSIS-RTOS to be present, it is not creating any additional threads.

**Using CMSIS-RTOS RTX v5**

The calling thread can be a thread with a default stack size (dynamic memory) or a thread with
a complete stack or only stack size provided using `osThreadAttr_t` structure (static or dynamic memory).

For the additional required stack size, please refer to the following table:

<table class="doxtable" summary="Memory Requirements">
    <tr>
      <th>Drive Type</th>
      <th  align="left">Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">RAM</td>
      <td>min. 0.6 kBytes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">MCI</td>
      <td>min. 0.7 kBytes + MCI Driver</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">NAND</td>
      <td>min. 1.3 kBytes + NAND Driver</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">NOR</td>
      <td>min. 0.4 kBytes + Flash Driver</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">USB</td>
      <td>min. 1.1 kBytes + USB Driver</td>
    </tr>
</table>

\note
- The stack in bytes stated is required to work with the files from top level functions like fopen, fclose, â€¦, fdelete,
  frename and so on.
- The drivers for the different types of drives require additional stack. This differs from device to device, but in general
  the stack usage for MCI, NAND, and Flash should not exceed additional 100 bytes. For USB drive, refer to \urlout{USB-Resource-Req}
  for details.
- If your application supports a combination of multiple drives, you need to configure your system to the the combined stack
  size for the sum of all drives. 

For \urlout{CMSIS-RTX5}, the threads requirements are configured in the \urlout{RTX-Conf-CM5} file located
under the **CMSIS** component class:

<table class="doxtable" summary="CMSIS-RTOS Configuration">
    <tr>
      <th align="left">Option (under section Thread Configuration)</th>
      <th>Increase Value by</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Default Thread stack size [bytes]</td>
      <td>Stack size from table above</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center" colspan="2">**or**</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Main Thread stack size [bytes]</td>
      <td>Stack size from table above</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center" colspan="2">**or**</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total stack size [bytes]for threads with user-provided stack size</td>
      <td>Stack size from table above</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### Mutex Requirements

Additionally, you may also need to adjust the memory used to allocate mutex objects required by the C stdio library.
Depending on the toolchain used, the total number of mutex objects required for proper operation may differ, but in
general every active file stream requires a mutex object.

\note Arm Standard C Library requires the following mutexes: 2 (internal stdio operations) + 3 (stdin, stdout and stderr file streams) + 1 for each active file stream

**Using CMSIS-RTOS RTX v5**

Memory for mutex objects is allocated from the dynamic memory pool (RTX_Config.h - System Configuration - Global Dynamic
Memory size [bytes]). The size of dynamic memory pool must be configured so that the control blocks for the mutexes mentioned
above fit inside. The size of a control block for a mutex depends on the RTOS2 implementation. For RTX5 can be found in
rtx_os.h and is equal to the size of `osRtxMutex_t`.

## Memory Requirements {#fs_spec_mem_req}

The following table shows the memory requirements for read-only (Flash) and read-write (RAM) memory.
These numbers may be used to estimate the total size requirements of the application, but the actual numbers depend
on compiler optimizations and target processor and may be therefore slightly different.
